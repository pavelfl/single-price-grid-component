 Many thanks to [Zach Gollwitzer](https://www.zachgollwitzer.com/) for his comprehensive online course on ["Frontend Web Development Bootcamp Course (JavaScript, HTML, CSS)"](https://youtu.be/zJSY8tbf_ys?feature=shared) on YouTube. His clear explanations and practical examples have greatly enhanced my understanding of frontend web development.
